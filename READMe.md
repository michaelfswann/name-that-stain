# Name That Stain!

Sing to the tune of stop that train :musical_note::steam_locomotive:

Name that stame is a mutliple choice game where, you guessed it, you have to name that stain!

Under construction but currently on hold while I finish SoC Bootcamp. 

### There is a a lot more to do
- Fetch requests from front end need finishing.
- Game element not built yet: currently just displays stains
- Styling is lacking (read: none existent)
- Currently using PostgreSQL need more stain entries, wanted to experiment with learning a new database too.
- Create seperate repos for client and server.
